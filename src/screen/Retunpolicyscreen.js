Return Policy

At NewShop, our goal is to ensure you have a seamless and satisfying shopping experience. If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, you can return the item under the following conditions:

1. Eligibility for Returns
   You can initiate a return within 30 days of receiving your order. The item must be unused, unwashed, and in its original packaging with all original tags, labels, and accessories intact. You must provide the original receipt or order confirmation as proof of purchase.

2. Non-Returnable Items
   Certain items are not eligible for return, including but not limited to:

* Perishable goods (e.g., food, flowers)
* Personal care items (e.g., hygiene products, cosmetics)
* Customized or personalized items
* Items marked as "Final Sale" or "Non-Returnable"
* Digital downloads and gift cards

3. Return Process
   To return an eligible item, please follow these steps:

* Visit the "My Orders" section in the app, select the item you want to return, and choose the "Return" option.
* Repack the item securely, including all original components.
* Use the prepaid shipping label provided, or choose your own carrier at your expense.
* Keep the tracking number for your return shipment to monitor its progress.

4. Refunds
   Refunds will be issued to the original payment method within 5-7 business days after the returned item is received and inspected. In some cases, a partial refund may be granted for items that are not in their original condition or are missing parts. Original shipping fees and handling charges are non-refundable.

5. Exchanges
   We currently do not offer direct exchanges. If you need a different size, color, or style, please return the original item and place a new order.
